The main file is ufo.cpp.
The functions.hpp file contains all the function declarations which are further defined in the file functions.cpp.
While compiling do not forget to link functions.cpp i.e., compile using the command g++ ufo.cpp functions.cpp and then followed by ./a.out.
The secret code is the word "shazam".
You can change the secret you as per your wish.
